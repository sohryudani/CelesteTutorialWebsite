        <h1>Introduction to Dashing</h1>

        <hr class="subHeaderLines">
        <p>
            Dashing is the primary method of gaining speed within Celeste. While dashing is 
            mandatory for completing the game in a casual playthrough, the use of dashing
            within a speedrun goes far beyond that of a casual playthrough. In order to achieve
            a fast time, runners will almost always be dashing to keep their speed as high
            as possible. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Many of the dashes used within a speedrun are relatively freeform, meaning
            that a runner can perform whichever moves they want between segments of the level that
            require precise timings or setups. As long as you're maintaining your momentum, almost
            any kind of dash will work. In the dashing section we'll go over more complicated dashes
            that utilize the most of the movement engine of the game.

        <p>
            As mentioned in the Basic Movement Tips page, during a speedrun you'll want to avoid the 
            ground like it's the plague. The reason for this is based in Celeste's momentum system.
            Whether you're on the ground or in the air, after a dash is completed, most of the momentum
            from it will be lost. However, if you intersect with a wall or the ground and cancel the dash
            with a jump, the momentum can be saved, or if you're on a moving platform, even greatly multiplied.
        </p>
        <p>
            The reason for staying away from the ground after completing a dash cancel jump is that on the
            ground (aside from a normal dash) momentum is lost much quicker that in the air. It is possible
            to maintain more of your speed after a dash cancel jump on the ground through bunnyhopping, but
            it's usually easier and more convenient to just dash again.
