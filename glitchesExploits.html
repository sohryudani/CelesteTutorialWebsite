        <h1>Glitches and Exploits</h1>

        <hr class="subHeaderLines">

        <p>
            For the purposes of beginning speedrunning there are three main glitches/exploits that
            you need to know, spikejumps, demodashes, and Bubsdrop. These are three of the most difficult
            single moves to pull off, so lots of practice is necessary to utilize these in a run.
        </p>

        <hr class="subHeaderLines">

        <h2>Spikejump</h2>

        <p>
            In Celeste, spikes only kill Madeline if she is traveling into the direction the spikes face.
            For example, if a set of spikes is placed on the right wall, Madeline will only be killed if she
            travels into them with any rightward momentum. If she goes into the spikes travelling left, up, or down,
            she will just pass through them.
        </p>
        <p>
            This mechanic is exploited in a spikejump, where you can jump from a tile where a spike is
            if you aren't travelling in the direction that the spikes face. The easiest useful spikejump
            is found in the third stage, "Celestial Resort", where you can spike jump off of the right wall
            of a room to skip the room.
        </p>
        <p>
            Spikejumps can also be performed on spikes that face upwards. This type of spikejump is used
            many times within the Any% run, it is noteably used many times in the first stage, "Forsaken City",
            to shorten many rooms.
        </p>

        <hr class="subHeaderLines">

        <h2>Demodash</h2>

        <p>
            While spikejumps are difficult to get used to performing, demodashes and Bubsdrops are on a whole
            different level. Demodashes allow you to dash through what would otherwise seem like impenetrable walls.
            Certain walls within the game, while appearing to be complete, actually contain gaps that are only
            large enough for Madeline to pass through if she is crouching. The most noteworthy use of a demodash
            in the Any% run is to skip a large portion of the third level, "Celestial Resort".
        </p>
        <p>
            Demodashes are performed by dashing downwards, then immediatly (within the span of four frames,
            or about .06 seconds) releasing the downward input. Doing so causes Madeline to dash horizontally. 
            However, it isn't a normal horizontal dash, as Madeline's hitbox is reduced to that of her crouching
            hit box, allowing for her to pass through the aforementioned holes.
        </p>
        
        <hr class="subHeaderLines">

        <h2>Bubsdrop</h2>

        <p>
            When Bubsdrop was first found, it was thought to be completely useless. Bubsdrop sees the player going through
            a vertical screen transition while close to a wall, then pressing the jump input in a tiny window,
            and immediatly buffering a release of the jump input during a less than four frame window. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Normally, when entering a vertical room transition, you are given a set vertical momentum and pushed upwards,
            making it impossible to return to the previous room. However, if a Bubsdrop is performed, Madeline
            will wall jump off of the wall at the perfect time, cancelling the vertical momentum and allowing you
            to fall back to the previous room.
        </p>
        <p>
            For beginner runners, Bubsdrop might be the single hardest trick in the speedrun, however, 
            it is vital to making the current Any% route of using the Mirror Temple B-Side viable.
