        <h1>Aerial Dashing</h1>

        <hr class="subHeaderLines">

        <p>
            In Celeste, without a surface to jump off of, dashes cannot be exploited to gain momentum.
            In this section, aerial dashing refers to dashing in the air and using a wall to cancel a
            dash.
        </p>

        <h2>Wallbounce</h2>

        <figure id="wallBounce" class="imageBox">
            <img src="images/wallbounce.gif" alt="Wallbounce gif" title="Wallbounce gif" 
                style="width:100%;">
            <figcaption>
                <p class="caption">
                    A wallbounce against a long wall. 
                </p>
            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            Wallbounces occur when the player dashes vertically next to a wall, and jumps off the wall
            during the dash to cancel it, maintaining the momentum that was gained from the dash. Wallbounces
            are the fastest way to travel up a wall, and are introduced in the B-Side of "The Summit".
            Depending on when the player jumps off the wall, the height gained from a wall bounce varies, 
            with the longer you wait to jump, the more height you gain. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Wallbounces can also be used in lieu of a wall jump, as they provide much more height, which
            allows Madeline to travel futher horizontally over time.

        <h2>Cornerboost</h2>

        <p>
            Cornerboosts are an extremely precise trick that allows the player to maintain any horizontal
            momentum after jumping off the top of the wall. To perform a corner boost, you must climb-jump
            off the top of a wall (about 5 pixels from the top is the limit) with correct timing.
            While it is a more niche trick than wallbouncing, it is extremely useful in the situations
            where it's used.
