        <hr class="subHeaderLines">

        <p>
            Mirror Temple B-Side is the only humanly viable B-Side in the current Any% run of Celeste.
            Mirror Temple B-Side is in a unique position because of many glitches and tricks that allow
            for a majority of the first section of the stage to be skipped.
        </p>

        <hr class="subHeaderLines">

        <h2>Skipping the Keys</h2>

        <p>
            There are three keys in the second section of Mirror Temple B-Side, and thanks to many
            tricks, all three can be skipped, making the B-side faster than the A-Side.
        </p>

        <h3>Bubsdrop's Usage</h3>

        <figure class="centerGif">
            <img id="bubsdrop" src="images/bubsdropFinal.gif" alt="Bubsdrop gif"
                title="Bubsdrop gif">
            <figcaption>
                <p class="caption">
                    Bubsdrop in Mirror Temple B-Side. 
                </p>
            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            As mentioned on the <a class="inTextLink" href="glitchesExploits.html">Glitches and Exploits</a> page,
            Bubsdrop is only utilized on Mirror Temple B-Side. The trick is utilized in the room directly to the
            right of the first checkpoint. You are intended to take the vertical exit at the right side of the room,
            then proceed to complete the room it leads to. However, if you perform a Bubsdrop, fall back into the room,
            pause the game, and click retry, Madeline will respawn on the platform at the right side of the room, 
            skipping three other rooms and saving over 20 seconds.
        </p>
        <p>
            This respawn exploitation works because most rooms in Celeste only have two respawn placements, one at the left
            and one at the right side of the room. Depending on where you enter the room, Madeline will respawn
            at one of these two points. The room where Bubsdrop is performed only has two respawn points, so if you
            enter the room from anywhere on the right half, Madeline will respawn at the room's rightmost exit.
            This accounts for the first keyskip.
        </p>

        <h3>Keyskip Two</h3>
        <p>
            Two rooms after Bubsdrop is performed, there is a long narrow spike passage that is meant to use a key to pass through.
            However, right before the spike passage, there is just enough room to perform an extended reverse-hyper.
            This hyper stays low enough to avoid all of the spikes, and gives you just enough distance to skip the 
            need for the second key in the level.
        </p>
        
        <figure class="centerGif">
            <img  id="keyskip2" src="images/keyskip2.gif" alt="Keyskip 2 gif" 
                title="Keyskip 2 gif" >
            <figcaption>
                <p class="caption">
                    Keyskip Two: an extended reverse-hyper.

            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3>Keyskip Three</h3>

        <figure class="imageBox" style="width:30%; margin-right:0; margin-top:0;
            max-height:300px; max-width:195px">
            <img src="images/keyskip3.gif" alt="Keyskip 3 gif" title="Keyskip 3 gif" 
                style="width:100%;">
            <figcaption>
                <p class="caption">
                    Keyskip three: a neutral spikejump. 
                </p>
            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            The final keyskip uses another exploit covered on the <a class="inTextLink" href="glitchesExploits.html">Glitches and Exploits</a> page,
            spikejumps. In the room immediatly after the second keyskip, there is a vertical column of spikes
            that is too tall to pass through with a dash. You are intended to collect a key to get passed this
            room, however, a spikejump allows you to avoid this key. You can spikejump off of the right wall of
            the column and dash upwards to skip the key.
        </p>
        <p>
            This trick will require lots of practice, as this is the hardest spikejump in the game. Due 
            to how narrow the column is, you must perfom a neutral spikejump, combining a neutral jump as introduced
            in the <a class="inTextLink" href="basicMovement.html">Basic Movement Tips</a> page, and a spkiejump,
            to reduce the horizontal distance the spike jump gives while maintaining the height gained.
        </p>

        <h2>After the Keys</h2>

        <p>
            From here on out in the level, it is just required that you complete the rest of the level well
            to save time from playing through the A-Side. This youtube video by Programmatic can be followed
            to learn the optimal methods to complete the rest of the rooms in the level.
