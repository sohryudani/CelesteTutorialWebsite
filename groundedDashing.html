        <h1>Grounded Dashing</h1>

        <hr class="subHeaderLines">

        <p>
            For the purposes of this website, all types of dash cancel jumps that utilize the ground
            to perform the dash cancel jump will fall under grounded dashing. This category is where a majority
            of the complicated dashes used within a speed run are found.
        </p>

        <hr class="subHeaderLines">

        <h2>Super</h2>

        <p>
            A super is the easiest of the grounded dashes. A super can be performed by dashing 
            sideways on the ground and immediatly following the dash up with a jump. Performing
            a super cancels the momentum loss that comes with the end of a dash and gives the player
            a large burst of speed. In a regular super, you cannot dash again after performing it.
        </p>

        <h3>Extended Super</h3>

        <figure class="imageBox" style="width:35%; margin-left:0; margin-top:0;
            max-height:266px; max-width:320px; float:left;">
            <img src="images/superfinal.gif" alt="Super gif" title="Super gif" 
                style="width:100%;">
            <figcaption>
                <p class="caption">
                    An extended reverse-super. 
                </p>
            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            On their own, supers don't cover much more distance than just jumping and then dashing,
            which is where extended supers come in. An extended super refers to a super in which the
            player maintains their ability to dash after executing the super. In order to perform an
            extended super, the player must stay on the ground for slightly longer, jumping once Madeline's
            hair turns red. If you stay on the ground past this point, the momentum from the super will be
            lost.
        </p>
        

        <h3>Reverse-Super</h3>

        <p>
            A reverse-super is very similar to a normal super, but can be done in tighter spaces. To
            perform a reverse-super, you dash in the direction opposite to the one you want to travel,
            switch directions and jump. A reverse-super follows the same timings as a standard super, 
            so it can also be extended.
        </p>

        <hr class="subHeaderLines">

        <h2>Hyper</h2>

        <p>
            A hyper is a more complicated form of ground dash that is introduced to the player in
            the C-Side of the level "Core". A hyper provides much more speed and distance than a
            super or a normal dash. Hypers give Madeline less height than a normal jump or a super,
            so can be used to traverse more narrow gaps. To perform a hyper, the player must dash
            diagonally downwards and jump before the dash ends. 
        </p>

            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3>Extended Hyper</h3>

        <p>
            Much like a super, a hyper can be extended to regain the ability to dash, making it
            an extremely versatile move in speedruns. To do this, dash diagonally downwards, and jump
            once Madeline's hair turns red again.
        </p>

            

        <h3>Reverse-Hyper</h3>

        <p>
            Hypers can also be reversed, however, as they take up very little space to perform in their
            standard iteration, there are only a few uses for reverse-hypers.
        </p>

        <hr class="subHeaderLines">

        <figure class="imageBox" style="width:40%; margin-right:0; margin-top:15px;
            max-height:240px; max-width:300px">
            <img src="images/wavedash.gif" alt="Wavedash gif" title="Wavedash gif" 
                style="width:100%;">

        </figure>

        <h2>Wavedash</h2>

        <p>
            The final form of major ground dashes is wavedashing, which gets its name from a similar
            movement option that was found in the game "Super Smash Bros. Melee". Wavedashes are introduced
            to the player in the epilogue level "Farewell", and serve as a key aspect of the level.
        </p>
        <p>
            Wavedashing is executed in a similar manner to a hyper, but starts with the player being airborn, dashing diagonally downwards,
            and jumping once they reach the ground. Wavedashes fill a similar movement niche as extended hypers,
            but give the player more height. Wavedashes can also be performed in a smaller area than a hyper,
            which requires more than one tile or a while, while one can wavedash on a one tile space.
